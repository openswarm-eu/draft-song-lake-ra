1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation is a security process which verifies and confirms
   the integrity and trustworthiness of a remote device or system in the
   network.  This process helps establish a level of trust in the remote
   system before allowing the device to e.g. join the network or access
   some sensitive information and resources.  The use cases that require
   remote attestation include secure boot and firmware management, cloud
   computing, network access control, etc.

   The IETF working group Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) has
   defined an architecture [RFC9334] for remote attestation.  The three
   main roles in the RATS architecture are the Attester, the Verifier
   and the Relying Party.  The Attester generates the evidence
   concerning its identity and integrity, which must be appraised by the
   Verifier for its validity.  Then, the Verifier produces the
   attestation result, which is consequently used by the Relying Party
   for the purposes of reliably applying application-specific actions.

   One type of interaction model defined in the RATS architecture is
   called the background-check model.  It resembles the procedure of how
   employers perform background checks to determine the prospective
   employee's trustworthiness, by contacting the respective organization
   that issues a report.  In this case, the employer acts as the Relying
   Party, the employee acts as the Attester and the organization acts as
   the Verifier.  The Attester conveys evidence directly to the Relying
   Party and the Relying Party forwards the evidence to the Verifier for
   appraisal.  Once the attestation result is computed by the Verifier,
   it is sent back to the Relying Party to decide what action to take
   based on the attestation result.  This specification employs the RATS
   background check model.

   One way of conveying attestation evidence is the Entity Attestation
   Token (EAT) [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].  It provides an attested claims set
   that describes the state and the characteristics of the Attester,
   which can be used to determine its level of trustworthiness.  This
   specification relies on the EAT as the attestation evidence.

   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] is a
   lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for highly
   constrained networks.  In EDHOC, the two parties involved in the key
   exchange are referred to as the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).
   EDHOC supports the transport of external authorization data, through
   the dedicated EAD fields.  This specification delivers EAT through
   EDHOC.  Specifically, EAT is transported as an EAD item.

   Typically, the Attester incorporates an internal attestation service,
   including a specific trusted element known as the "root of trust".
   Root of trust serves as the starting point for establishing and
   validating the trustworthiness appraisals of other components on the
   system.  The measurements signed by the attestation service are
   referred to as the Evidence.  The signing is requested through an
   attestation API.  How the components are separated between the secure
   and non-secure worlds on a device is out of scope of this
   specification.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in EDHOC [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] and RATS [RFC9334].

3.  Problem Description

   This specification describes how to perform remote attestation over
   the EDHOC protocol according to the RATS architecture.  Remote
   attestation protocol elements are carried within EDHOC's External
   Authorization Data (EAD) fields.  More specifically, this
   specification supports the RATS background check model.  It describes
   how the Attester (EDHOC Initiator) and Relying Party (EDHOC
   Responder) complete the EDHOC handshake complemented with remote
   attestation protocol elements.

4.  Assumptions

   The details of the protocol between Relying Party and Verifier are
   out of the scope.  The only assumption is that the Verifier outputs a
   fresh nonce and that same nonce is passed on to the EDHOC session.
   That is where the link between the two protocols comes in.  The
   remainder, such as the evidence type selection is just the
   negotiation.  In general, the Verifier is supposed to know how to
   verify more than one format of the evidence type.  Therefore, the
   Verifier MUST send back at least one format to the Relying Party.  We
   assume in this specification, the Relying Party also has knowledge
   about the Attester, so it can narrow down the type selection and send
   to the Attester only one format of evidnece type.

   The Attester should have an explicit relation with the Verifier, such
   as from device manufacuture, so that the Verifier can evaluate the
   Evidence that is produced by the Attester.  The authentication
   between the Attester and the Relying Party is performed with EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] and defines the process of remote attestation
   using the External Authorization Data (EAD) fields defined in EDHOC.

5.  The Protocol

5.1.  Overview

   EDHOC Initiator plays the role of the RATS Attester.  EDHOC Responder
   plays the role of the RATS Relying Party.  An external entity, out of
   scope of this specification, plays the role of the RATS Verifier.

    +----------+ Attestation  +-----------+               +----------+
    |          | proposal     |           |   Provided    |          |
    | Attester +------------->|  Relying  | EvidenceTypes | Verifier |
    |          |              |           +-------------->|          |

    |          | request      |           |               |          |
    |   (A)    |              |   (RP)    |               |   (V)    |
    |          | Evidence     |           |   Evidence    |          |
    |          +------------->|           +-------------->|          |
    |          |              |           |<--------------+          |
    |          |              |           |  Attestation  |          |
    |          |              |           |  Result       |          |
    +----------+              +-----------+               +----------+

      Figure 1: Overview of message flow.  EDHOC is used between A and
       RP.  Remote attestation proposal and request are sent in EDHOC
      External Authorization Data (EAD).  The link between V and RP is
                    out of scope of this specification.

   The Attester and the Relying Party communicate by transporting
   messages within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.

5.2.  External Authorization Data 1

   In EAD_1, the Attester transports the Proposed_EvidenceType object.
   It signals to the Relying Party the proposal to do remote
   attestation, as well as which attestation claims the Attester
   supports.  The supported attestation claims are encoded in CBOR in
   the form of a sequence.

   The external authorization data EAD_1 contains an EAD item with

   *  ead_label = TBD1

   *  ead_value = Attestation_proposal, which is a CBOR byte string:

   Attestation_proposal = bstr .cbor Proposed_EvidenceType

   Proposed_EvidenceType = (
           content-format:         [ + uint]
   )

   where

   *  content-format is an array that contains all the supported
      evidence types by the Attester in decreasing order of preference.

   *  There MUST be at least one item in the array.

   *  content-format is an indicator of the format type (e.g.,
      application/eat+cwt with an appropriate eat_profile parameter
      set).

   The sign of ead_label MUST be negative to indicate that the EAT item
   is critical.  If the receiver cannot recognize the critical EAD item,
   or cannot process the information in the critical EAD item, then the
   receiver MUST send an EDHOC error message back.

5.3.  External Authorization Data 2

   In EAD_2, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the supported and
   requested evidence types.  In case none of the evidence types is
   supported, the Relying Party rejects the first message_1 with an
   error indicating support for another evidence type.

   EAD_2 carries the Selected_EvidenceType object.  Similarly to EAD_1,
   Selected_EvidenceType object is encoded in CBOR.

   The external authorization data EAD_2 contains an EAD item with

   *  ead_label = TBD2

   *  ead_value = Attestation_request, which is a CBOR byte string:

   Attestation_request = bstr .cbor Selected_EvidenceType
   Selected_EvidenceType = (
           content-format:uint,
           nonce:bstr
   )

   where

   *  content-format is the selected evidence type by the Relying Party
      and supported by the Verifier.

   *  nonce is generated by the Verifier and forwarded by the Relying
      Party.

5.4.  External Authorization Data 3

   As a response to the attestation request, the Attester calls its
   local attestation service to generate and return the serialized EAT
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] as Evidence.

   The external authorization data EAD_3 contains an EAD item with

   *  ead_label = TBD3

   *  ead_value is a serialized EAT.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Security considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following entry in the "EDHOC
   External Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral
   Diffie-Hellman Over Cose (EDHOC)".  The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds
   to the ead_value Attestation_proposal in EAD_1 with processing
   specified in Section 5.2.  The ead_label = TBD2 corresponds to the
   ead_value Attestation_request in Section 5.3.  The ead_label = TBD3
   corresponds to the ead_value which carries the EAT, as specified in
   Section 5.4.

         +=======+============+=================================+
         | Label | Value Type | Description                     |
         +=======+============+=================================+
         |  TBD1 | bstr       | Attestation Proposal            |
         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+
         |  TBD2 | bstr       | Attestation Request             |
         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+
         |  TBD3 | bstr       | Evidence for remote attestation |
         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+

Appendix B.  Example: Firmware Version

   The goal in this example is to verify that the firmware running on
   the device is the latest version, and is neither tampered or
   compromised.  A device acts as the Attester, currently in an
   untrusted state.  The Attester needs to generate the Evidence to
   attest itself.  A gateway that can communicate with the Attester and
   can control its access to the network acts as the Relying Party.  The
   gateway will finally decide whether the device can join the network
   or not depending on the Attestation Result.  The Attestation Result
   is produced by the Verifier, which is a web server that can be seen
   as the manufacturer of the device.  Therefore it can appraise the
   Evidence that is sent by the Attester.  The remote attestation
   session starts with the Attester sending EAD_1 in EDHOC message 1, as
   specified in Section 5.2.  In EAD_1 field, the Attester indicates
   that the format of EAT is in CWT and the profile of EAT is Platform
   Security Architecture (PSA) attestation token
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token].  PSA attestation token contains the
   claims relating to the security state of the platform, which are
   provided by PSA's Initial Attestation API.

   Therefore, the EAD_1 in EDHOC message_1 is:

   TBD

   According to [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token], IANA is requested to
   register the Content-Format ID in the "CoAP Content-Formats" registry
   [IANA-CoAP-Content-Formats], for the application/eat+cwt media type
   with the eat_profile parameter equal to
   tag:psacertified.org,2023:psa#tfm.

   The Media Type equivalent is:

media-type: application/eat+cwt; eat_profile="tag:psacertified.org,2023:psa#tfm"

   If the Verifier and the Relying Party can support this evidence type
   that is proposed by the Attester, the Relying Party will include in
   the EAD_2 field the same evidence type, alongside a nonce for message
   freshness.

   TBD

   The Evidence in EAD_3 field is the Platform Security Architecture
   (PSA) attestation token, which is the attestation of the platform
   state to assure the firmware integrity.  This can be generated from
   Measured boot, which creates the measurements of loaded code and data
   during the boot process and make them part of an overall chain of
   trust.  Each stage of the chain of trust stores the measurements in a
   local root of trust, then the Root of Trust for Report (RTR) of the
   device can use them as materials to generate the Evidence.  The
   components of the Evidence should at least be:

   TBD

   The Relying Party (co-located with the gateway) then treats the
   Evidence as opaque and sends it to the Verifier.  Once the Verifier
   sends back the Attestation Result, the Relying Party can be assured
   on the version of the firmware that the device is running.
