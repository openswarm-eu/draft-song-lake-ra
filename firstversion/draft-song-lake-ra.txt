                     Remote attestation over EDHOC
                       draft-song-lake-ra-latest

Abstract

   Remote attestation is a security process in which an entity, acting
   as the attester, provides evidence to a remote entity, acting as the
   verifier, in order to demonstrate the integrity and security
   properties of its software or hardware.  The evidence that is
   generated by the attester needs to be evaluated and verified by the
   verifier in order to determine the level of trust and to ensure that
   the attester has not been compromised or altered.  This document
   specifies how to perform remote attestation via a very compact and
   lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol EDHOC
   (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE), based on the Remote ATtestation
   procedureS (RATS) architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation is a security process which verifies and confirms
   the integrity and trustworthiness of a remote device or system in the
   network.  This process helps establish a level of trust in the remote
   system before allowing the device to e.g. join the network or access
   some sensitive information and resources.  The use cases that require
   remote attestation include secure boot and firmware management, cloud
   computing, network access control.

   The IETF working group Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) has
   defined an architecture [RFC9334] for remote attestation.  The three
   main roles in the RATS architecture are the Attester, the Verifier
   and the Relying Party.  The Attester generates the evidence
   concerning its identity and integrity, which must be appraised by the
   Verifier for its validity.  Then, the Verifier produces the
   attestation result, which is consequently used by the Relying Party
   for the purposes of reliably applying application-specific actions.

   One type of interaction model defined in the RATS architecture is
   called the background-check model.  It resembles the procedure of how
   employers perform background checks to determine the prospective
   employee's trustworthiness, by contacting the respective organization
   that issues a report.  In this case, the employer acts as the Relying
   Party, the employee acts as the Attester and the organization acts as
   the Verifier.  The Attester conveys evidence directly to the Relying
   Party and the Relying Party forwards the evidence to the Verifier for
   appraisal.  Once the attestation result is computed by the Verifier,
   it is sent back to the Relying Party to decide what action to take
   based on the attestation result.  This specification employs the RATS
   background check model.

   One way of conveying attestation evidence is the Entity Attestation
   Token (EAT) [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].  It provides an attested claims set
   that describes the state and the characteristics of the attester,
   which can be used to determine its level of trustworthiness.  This
   specification relies on the EAT as the attestation evidence.

   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] is a
   lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for highly
   constrained networks.  In EDHOC, the two parties involved in the key
   exchange are referred to as the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).
   EDHOC supports the transport of external authorization data, through
   the dedicated EAD fields.  This specification delivers EAT through
   EDHOC.  Specifically, EAT is transported as an EAD item.

   Typically, the Attester incorporates an internal attestation service,
   including a specific trusted element known as the "root of trust".
   Root of trust serves as the starting point for establishing and
   validating the trustworthiness appraisals of other components on the
   system.  The measurements signed by the attestation service are
   referred to as the Evidence.  The signing is requested through an
   attestation API.  How the components are separated between the secure
   and non-secure worlds on a device is out of scope of this
   specification.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in EDHOC [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] and RATS [RFC9334].

3.  Problem Description

   This specification describes how to perform remote attestation over
   the EDHOC protocol according to the RATS architecture.  Remote
   attestation protocol elements are carried within EDHOC's External
   Authorization Data (EAD) fields.  More specifically, this
   specification supports the RATS background check model.  It describes
   how the Attester (EDHOC Initiator) and Relying Party (EDHOC
   Responder) complete the EDHOC handshake complemented with remote
   attestation protocol elements.

4.  Assumptions

   The details of the protocol between Relying Party and Verifier are
   out of the scope.  The only assumption is that the Verifier outputs a
   fresh nonce and that same nonce is passed on to the EDHOC session.
   That is where the link between the two protocols comes in.  The
   remainder, such as the evidence type selection is just the
   negotiation.  In general, the Verifier is supposed to know how to
   verify more than one format.  However, we assume in this
   specification, the Relying Party has no knowledge for the appraisal
   of Evdience, therefore is not involved in the type selection.  So the
   Verifier will narrow down the selection itself to only one format.

   The Attester should have an explicit relation with the Verifier, such
   as from device manufacuture, so that the Verifier can evaluate the
   Evidence that is produced by the Attester.

5.  The Protocol

5.1.  Overview

   EDHOC Initiator plays the role of the RATS Attester.  EDHOC Responder
   plays the role of the RATS Relying Party.  An external entity, out of
   scope of this specification, plays the role of the RATS Verifier.

          Remote attestation
          request

      Figure 1: Overview of message flow.  EDHOC is used between A and
       RP.  Remote attestation proposal and request are sent in EDHOC
      External Authorization Data (EAD).  The link between V and RP is
                    out of scope of this specification.

   The Attester and the Relying Party communicate by transporting
   messages within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.

5.2.  External Authorization Data 1

   In EAD_1, the Attester transports the Proposed_EvidenceType object.
   EvidenceType signals to the Relying Party the proposal to do remote
   attestation, as well as which attestation claims the Attester
   supports.  The supported attestation claims are encoded in CBOR in
   the form of a sequence.

   The external authorization data EAD_1 contains an EAD item with *
   ead_label = TBD1 * ead_value = Attestation_proposal, which is a CBOR
   byte string:

   Attestation_proposal = bstr .cbor Proposed_EvidenceType

   Proposed_EvidenceType = (
           content-format:         [ + uint]
   )

   where

   *  content-format is a list that contains all the supported evidence
      types in decreasing order of preference.

   *  There MUST be at least one item in the list.

   The sign of ead_label needs to be negative to indicate that the EAT
   item is critical.  If the receiver cannot recognize the critical EAD
   item, or cannot process the information in the critical EAD item,
   then the receiver MUST send an EDHOC error message back.

5.3.  External Authorization Data 2

   In EAD_2, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the supported and
   requested attestation claims.  In case none of the evidence types is
   supported, the Relying Party rejects the first message_1 with an
   error indicating support for another evidence type.

   EAD_2 carries the Selected_EvidenceType object.  Similarly to EAD_1,
   Selected_EvideceType object is encoded in CBOR.

   The external authorization data EAD_2 contains an EAD item with *
   ead_label = TBD2 * ead_value = Attestation_request, which is a CBOR
   byte string:

   Attestation_Request = bstr .cbor Selected_EvidenceType
   Selected_EvidenceType = (
           content-format:uint,
           nonce:bstr
   )

   where

   *  content-format is the selected evidence type by the appraisal
      entity.

   *  nonce is generated from the appraisal entity.

5.4.  External Authorization Data 3

   As a response to the attestation request, the Attester calls its
   local attestation service to generate and return the serialized EAT
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] as Evidence.  EDHOC uses Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR)[RFC8949] for encoding, so the EAT in this
   specification should be encoded in CBOR and built on CBOR Web Token
   (CWT)[RFC8392].

   The external authorization data EAD_3 contains an EAD item with *
   ead_label = TBD3 * ead_value = Evidence, which is a CBOR byte string:

   Evidence = bstr .cbor eat
   eat = {
           + Claim Key: Claim Value Type
   }

   where eat is composed of one or more Claim key in Claim Value Type,
   from the "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry[IANA.CWT.Claims] .

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Security considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

   IANA has registered the following entry in the "EDHOC External
   Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over Cose (EDHOC)".  The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds to the
   ead_value Attestation_proposal in EAD_1 with processing specified in
   Section 5.2.  The ead_label = TBD2 corresponds to the ead_value
   Attestation_request in Section 5.3.  The ead_label = TBD3 corresponds
   to the ead_value Evidence in Section 5.4 in this specification.

         +=======+============+=================================+
         | Label | Value Type | Description                     |
         +=======+============+=================================+

         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+
         |  TBD2 | bstr       | Attestation Request             |
         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+
         |  TBD3 | bstr       | Evidence for remote attestation |
         +-------+------------+---------------------------------+
